C features

1. *void
This means a pointer of any kinds of point

2. (*test)(int,int)

This is a function pointer.

How to use:
(*test)(int,int) is just an announcement.
To use it, define it like
test = func1;
test = func2; // however this

then call it with parameter values:
test(1,2);     // however this is wrong
test(123,456); // however this is wrong

and this will get the return value or just let cpu do something.

When it is announced in function like:
void doSome(char a, char b, (*test)(const char*, const char*))

It means doSome method allows to pass a function pointer into it.
So we combine 2 and 3, we shall call like:

doSome('a', 'b', test);

But how to define doSome function?
They say (*test)(1 ,2) is the best but what is it in 2???

I am sure 2 is wrong, because when we want call function we must first get 
its position in memory by (*). And then call the parameters.
So 2 is wrong, we must call like:
(*test)(1,2);     // however this is OK
(*test)(123,456); // however this is OK

_Packed 这个是用来字节对其的
