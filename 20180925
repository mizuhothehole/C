cpp learning of this morning

1.cpp has the constructor like:

class A {

private:
int a;

protected:
  int getA(){
    return this->a;
  }

public:
  A(){
    this->a=222;
  }
  
  virtual void ToBeOverridedMethod();
  
  ~A(){
    cout << "the class is now over!" << endl;
  }

}

in this class defination, the "this" syntax means the pointer of this class itself. The point is that, it is a "pointer".

2. cpp also has the destructor, but like above.

3. to announce a class that could be overrided, we MUST announce a method like virtual MethodName.
Like in the sample the "virtual void ToBeOverridedMethod()".

4. To extend a class, in cpp we use ":". Something like A:public B. I saw a lot of samples and they always use the "public"
brfore the class extended.

5. Even the basic data types, if we use the "&", we also could change the value of it even in method, because it is passing the "real value".
